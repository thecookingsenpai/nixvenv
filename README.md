# NixVenv

## A pythonesque venv like approach to system virtual environments

### What is this?

Just as Python's venv allows developers to specify virtual environments for their python projects, NixVenv goal is to provide developers with the possibility to create virtual environments for their whole system.

Have you ever met a dependency that is required but would break your code elsewhere in your system? With NixVenv you can create a virtual environment for that specific application and run it with customized files, environment variables and configurations. Once you have finished, just deactivate it and you will be back in your usual shell environment.

### Features

[ x ] Customizable environment variables
